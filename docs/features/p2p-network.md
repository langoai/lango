# P2P Network

!!! warning "Experimental"

    The P2P networking system is experimental. The protocol and configuration may change in future releases.

Lango supports decentralized agent-to-agent connectivity via libp2p. The Sovereign Agent Network (SAN) enables peer-to-peer communication with DID-based identity, zero-knowledge enhanced handshake, and a knowledge firewall for access control.

## Overview

The P2P subsystem enables direct agent communication without centralized coordination:

- **Direct connectivity** -- agents connect peer-to-peer using libp2p with Noise encryption
- **DID-based identity** -- each agent derives a `did:lango:<pubkey>` identity from its wallet
- **Knowledge firewall** -- default deny-all ACL controls which peers can access which tools
- **Agent discovery** -- GossipSub-based agent card propagation for capability-based search
- **ZK-enhanced handshake** -- optional zero-knowledge proof verification during peer authentication

## Identity

Each Lango agent derives a decentralized identifier (DID) from its wallet's compressed secp256k1 public key:

```
did:lango:<hex-compressed-pubkey>
```

The DID is deterministically mapped to a libp2p peer ID, ensuring cryptographic binding between the wallet identity and the network identity. Private keys never leave the wallet layer.

## Handshake

When two agents connect, they perform mutual DID-based authentication:

1. **TCP/QUIC connection** established via libp2p with Noise encryption
2. **DID exchange** -- each peer presents its `did:lango:...` identifier
3. **Signature verification** -- DID public key is verified against the peer ID
4. **Session token** -- a time-limited session token is issued for subsequent queries
5. **(Optional) ZK proof** -- when `p2p.zkHandshake` is enabled, a zero-knowledge proof of identity is verified

Session tokens have a configurable TTL (`p2p.sessionTokenTtl`). Expired tokens require re-authentication.

## Knowledge Firewall

The knowledge firewall enforces access control for peer queries. The default policy is **deny-all** -- explicit rules must be added to allow access.

### ACL Rules

Each rule specifies:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `peerDid` | Peer DID this rule applies to (`"*"` for all peers) |
| `action` | `"allow"` or `"deny"` |
| `tools` | Tool name patterns (supports `*` wildcard, empty = all tools) |
| `rateLimit` | Maximum requests per minute (0 = unlimited) |

### Response Sanitization

All responses to peer queries are automatically sanitized:

- Absolute file paths are redacted
- Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, private keys) are stripped
- Internal IDs and database paths are removed

### ZK Attestation

When `p2p.zkAttestation` is enabled, responses include a zero-knowledge proof that the response was generated by the claimed agent without revealing internal state.

## Approval Pipeline

Inbound P2P tool invocations pass through a three-stage gate before execution:

```mermaid

    A[Incoming Tool Request] --> B{Firewall ACL}
    B -- Deny --> X[Reject]
    B -- Allow --> C{Reputation Check}
    C -- Below minTrustScore --> X
    C -- Pass --> D{Owner Approval}
    D -- Denied --> X
    D -- Approved --> E[Execute Tool]
    E --> F[Sanitize Response]
    F --> G[Return Result]

    D -. "Auto-approve shortcut" .-> E
    style X fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style E fill:#22c55e,color:#fff
```

### Stage 1: Firewall ACL

The [Knowledge Firewall](#knowledge-firewall) evaluates static allow/deny rules by peer DID and tool name pattern. Requests that don't match any allow rule are rejected immediately.

### Stage 2: Reputation Check

If a reputation checker is configured, the peer's trust score is verified against `minTrustScore` (default: 0.3). New peers with no history (score = 0) are allowed through. Peers with a score above 0 but below the threshold are rejected.

### Stage 3: Owner Approval

The local agent owner is prompted to approve or deny the tool invocation. This stage supports several auto-approval shortcuts:

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Paid tool, price < `autoApproveBelow`** | Auto-approved if within spending limits (`maxPerTx`, `maxDaily`) |
| **`autoApproveKnownPeers: true`** | Previously authenticated peers skip handshake approval |
| **Free tool** | Always requires interactive owner approval |

When auto-approval conditions are not met, the request falls back to the composite approval provider (Telegram inline keyboard, Discord button, Slack interactive message, or terminal prompt).

## Discovery

Agent discovery uses GossipSub for decentralized agent card propagation:

1. Each agent publishes its **Agent Card** periodically on the `/lango/agentcard/1.0.0` topic
2. Cards include: name, description, DID, multiaddrs, capabilities, pricing, and ZK credentials
3. Peers can search for agents by capability tag using `FindByCapability`
4. ZK credentials on cards are verified before acceptance

### Agent Card Structure

```json
{
  "name": "my-agent",
  "description": "Research assistant",
  "did": "did:lango:02abc...",
  "multiaddrs": ["/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/9000"],
  "capabilities": ["research", "code-review"],
  "pricing": {
    "currency": "USDC",
    "perQuery": "0.01"
  },
  "peerId": "QmAbc..."
}
```

## ZK Circuits

When ZK features are enabled, Lango uses four zero-knowledge circuits:

| Circuit | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Identity | Prove DID ownership without revealing the private key |
| Membership | Prove membership in an authorized peer set |
| Range | Prove a value falls within a range (e.g., reputation score) |
| Attestation | Prove response authenticity without revealing internal state |

Configure the proving scheme via `p2p.zkp.provingScheme` (`"plonk"` or `"groth16"`).

## Configuration

> **Settings:** `lango settings` → P2P Network

```json
{
  "p2p": {
    "enabled": true,
    "listenAddrs": ["/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9000"],
    "bootstrapPeers": [],
    "keyDir": "~/.lango/p2p",
    "enableRelay": false,
    "enableMdns": true,
    "maxPeers": 50,
    "handshakeTimeout": "30s",
    "sessionTokenTtl": "1h",
    "autoApproveKnownPeers": false,
    "firewallRules": [
      {
        "peerDid": "*",
        "action": "allow",
        "tools": ["search_*"],
        "rateLimit": 10
      }
    ],
    "gossipInterval": "30s",
    "zkHandshake": false,
    "zkAttestation": false,
    "zkp": {
      "proofCacheDir": "~/.lango/zkp",
      "provingScheme": "plonk"
    }
  }
}
```

See the [Configuration Reference](../configuration.md#p2p-network) for all P2P settings.

## REST API

When the gateway is running (`lango serve`), read-only P2P endpoints are available for monitoring and external integrations:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/p2p/status` | Peer ID, listen addresses, connected peer count |
| `GET /api/p2p/peers` | List of connected peers with multiaddresses |
| `GET /api/p2p/identity` | Local DID (`did:lango:...`) and peer ID |
| `GET /api/p2p/reputation` | Peer trust score and exchange history |
| `GET /api/p2p/pricing` | Tool pricing (single or all tools) |

```bash
# Check node status
curl http://localhost:18789/api/p2p/status

# List connected peers
curl http://localhost:18789/api/p2p/peers

# Get DID identity
curl http://localhost:18789/api/p2p/identity

# Query peer reputation
curl "http://localhost:18789/api/p2p/reputation?peer_did=did:lango:02abc..."

# Get tool pricing
curl http://localhost:18789/api/p2p/pricing
curl "http://localhost:18789/api/p2p/pricing?tool=knowledge_search"
```

These endpoints query the running server's persistent P2P node. They are public (no authentication) and expose only node metadata. See the [HTTP API Reference](../gateway/http-api.md#p2p-network) for response format details.

## CLI Commands

The CLI commands create ephemeral P2P nodes for one-off operations, independent of the running server:

```bash
lango p2p status               # Show node status
lango p2p peers                # List connected peers
lango p2p connect <multiaddr>  # Connect to a peer
lango p2p disconnect <peer-id> # Disconnect from a peer
lango p2p firewall list        # List firewall rules
lango p2p firewall add         # Add a firewall rule
lango p2p discover             # Discover agents
lango p2p identity             # Show local identity
lango p2p reputation --peer-did <did>  # Query trust score
lango p2p pricing              # Show tool pricing
```

See the [P2P CLI Reference](../cli/p2p.md) for detailed command documentation.

## Paid Value Exchange

Lango supports paid P2P tool invocations via the **Payment Gate**. When pricing is enabled, remote peers must pay in USDC before invoking tools.

### Payment Gate Flow

1. **Price Query** — The caller queries the provider's pricing via `p2p_price_query` or `GET /api/p2p/pricing`
2. **Price Quote** — The provider returns a `PriceQuoteResult` with the tool price in USDC
3. **Payment** — The caller sends USDC via `p2p_pay` to the provider's wallet address
4. **Tool Invocation** — After payment confirmation, the caller invokes the tool via `p2p_query`

### Auto-Approval for Small Amounts

When `payment.limits.autoApproveBelow` is set, small payments are auto-approved without user confirmation. The auto-approval check evaluates three conditions:

1. **Threshold** — the payment amount is strictly below `autoApproveBelow`
2. **Per-transaction limit** — the amount does not exceed `maxPerTx`
3. **Daily limit** — the cumulative daily spend (including this payment) does not exceed `maxDaily`

If any condition fails, the system falls back to interactive approval via the configured channel (Telegram, Discord, Slack, or terminal).

This applies to both outbound payments (`p2p_pay`, `payment_send`) and inbound paid tool invocations where the owner's approval pipeline checks the tool price against the spending limiter.

### USDC Registry

Payment settlements use on-chain USDC transfers. The system supports multiple chains via the `contracts.LookupUSDC()` registry. Wallet addresses are derived from peer DIDs.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "p2p": {
    "pricing": {
      "enabled": true,
      "perQuery": "0.10",
      "toolPrices": {
        "knowledge_search": "0.25",
        "browser_navigate": "0.50"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Reputation System

The reputation system tracks peer behavior across exchanges and computes a trust score.

### Trust Score Formula

```
score = successes / (successes + failures×2 + timeouts×1.5 + 1.0)
```

The score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The `minTrustScore` configuration (default: 0.3) sets the threshold for accepting requests from peers.

### Exchange Tracking

Each peer interaction is recorded:
- **Success** — Tool invocation completed normally
- **Failure** — Tool invocation returned an error
- **Timeout** — Tool invocation timed out

### Querying Reputation

- **CLI**: `lango p2p reputation --peer-did <did>`
- **Agent Tool**: `p2p_reputation` with `peer_did` parameter
- **REST API**: `GET /api/p2p/reputation?peer_did=<did>`

New peers with no reputation record are given the benefit of the doubt (trusted by default).

## Owner Shield

The Owner Shield prevents owner PII from leaking through P2P responses. When configured, it sanitizes all outgoing P2P responses to remove:

- Owner name, email, and phone number
- Custom extra terms (e.g., company name, address)
- Conversation history (when `blockConversations` is true, which is the default)

### Configuration

```json
{
  "p2p": {
    "ownerProtection": {
      "ownerName": "Alice",
      "ownerEmail": "alice@example.com",
      "ownerPhone": "+1234567890",
      "extraTerms": ["Acme Corp"],
      "blockConversations": true
    }
  }
}
```
