# P2P Knowledge Exchange Track

## Document Ownership

- Primary capability area: `External Collaboration & Economic Exchange`
- Primary execution track: `P2P Knowledge Exchange Track`
- Secondary capability areas:
  - `Trust, Security & Policy`
  - `Execution, Continuity & Accountability`
- Secondary tracks:
  - `Stabilization Track`

This track charter follows `docs/architecture/master-document.md` as the top-level source of truth.

## Goal

Define the first concrete external market activity for sovereign Lango agents:

- expertise access,
- reviewable deliverables,
- bounded exportability,
- trusted settlement,
- dispute-ready receipts.

## Why This Track Comes First

Lango should reach meaningful external economic activity before it tries to support broad external execution or long-running multi-agent organizations.

Knowledge exchange is the narrowest useful slice because it:

- creates real external value,
- forces trust and exportability boundaries to become explicit,
- produces reviewable artifacts,
- creates a clean bridge toward later team execution.

## Relationship to Later Team Execution

This track is intentionally narrower than leader-led team execution.

It establishes the trust, settlement, deliverable, and exportability boundaries that later team-based collaboration depends on, without taking on full role orchestration, delegated budget control, or broader shared-workspace behavior. Leader-led team execution builds on these boundaries rather than replacing them.

The exportability policy work has already started as a first slice: source-based evaluation and operator visibility are now landed. Approval flow now has a first slice too: structured artifact release approval states and audit-backed receipts are landed, while human approval UI, upfront payment approval runtime, dispute orchestration, and partial settlement execution remain pending. The remaining exportability work is richer policy rules, explicit override/dispute handling, and receipt unification.

## In Scope

- pseudonymous but cryptographically continuous identities,
- owner-root trust plus agent-specific reputation,
- allowlist plus explicit exportability policy,
- structured artifact release approval and audit-backed release receipts,
- expertise access and reviewable deliverables,
- small upfront payment plus approval-based final settlement,
- on-chain stablecoin as the trust anchor,
- off-chain accrual only after trust is established,
- dispute handling grounded in signed logs, provenance, acceptance criteria, escrow state, and immutable receipts.

## Out of Scope

- unrestricted remote execution,
- full team-based role orchestration,
- live shared workspaces by default,
- complete reputation formula design,
- final smart-contract design,
- human approval UI,
- upfront payment approval runtime,
- dispute orchestration,
- partial settlement execution.

## Default Transaction Shape

1. A leader agent discovers or selects an external counterparty.
2. The leader agent confirms the target artifact is tradeable under exportability policy.
3. The parties agree on price, delivery window, and deliverable scope.
4. A small upfront payment or escrowed commitment is created.
5. The external agent delivers a reviewable artifact.
6. The leader agent approves, rejects, or disputes the artifact.
7. Final settlement is released on approval or handled through dispute rules.

## Required Follow-On Plans

1. `P2P identity / trust / reputation` detailed audit
2. `pricing / negotiation / settlement` detailed audit
3. exportability policy follow-on work (the first source-primary slice has landed; the remaining gaps are richer rules, override/dispute handling, and receipt unification)
4. approval-flow follow-on work (artifact release approval has landed; remaining gaps are human approval UI, upfront payment approval runtime, dispute orchestration, and partial settlement execution)
5. first implementation plan for the `knowledge exchange` runtime path
